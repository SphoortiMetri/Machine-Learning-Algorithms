K- Means clustering

K-means is a very popular clustering algorithm. t scales well to large number of samples and has been used across a large range of application areas in various fields

How it works: 
1. We first select the number of classes and randomly select data points that are repective groups' center points
2. By computing the distance between each point and the group center, it then classifies the point to be in the group whose center is the closest 
3. The group center is then recalculated as the mean of all vectors in the group 
4. Repeat these steps for a set of iterations or until the group centers don't change much with each iteration 
5. You can also opt to randomly initialize the group centers a few times, and then select the run that looks like it provided the best results.

Advantages: 
1. Fast 
  Linear time - O(n) 

Disadvantages: 
1. Number of clusters to be known prior to running the algorithm 
2. Since it randomly selects the group centers, it may not yield consistent results on multiple runs
